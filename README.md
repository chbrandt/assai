# ASsAI

We call it the Advanced Spectral Analysis Interface, *assai* -- pronounced as the brazilian fruit *açaí*, in honour to my italian supervisor, passionate about it; He has a point.

The tool in its full capabilities is meant to be an interactive
interface to explore photometric
data available through the VO network in the format of a spectral
energy distribution plot.

Nevertheless, the tool also provide the query-only interface for the
user not interested in graphical outputs.

## howto

`assai` reads the catalog services defined in `$ASSAI_DATA`, where
each service is defined by a python module or package
